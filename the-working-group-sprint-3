<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/4/event_501900836.jpeg" border="0" /><br /><br />Welcome the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong>, a virtual support group for <strong>Boston PHP</strong> members. This group has been created to help the overworked and underworked land a better gig and the unworked land big.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint #3 Update</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nine members signed up for <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Seven members have chosen not to engage with <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong> at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you engage with <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong>? You post an update on the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> message board.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong> is open to all Boston PHP members and will continue until at least May 31, 2022. The objective is to help one another work better. This could take one of two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>help the unworked find meaningful work</li>
<li>help the currently employed find more meaningful work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaningful work is defined by you. For some, it might mean greater pay and better benefits. For others it might take the form of better use of current skills or the opportunity to develop new skills.</p>
<p>Job search is a contact sport. The more contacts you make with your fellow Boston PHP members and beyond, the more we can help you achieve your goal. We can't help you if you won't share your goal.</p>
