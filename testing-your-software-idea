Narrowing the skills gap one video at a time.

So, you have an idea for a software product or service. Can your idea become a money-making venture? Where to begin?

Before you launch a new business venture, it's critical that you validate and test your idea to determine if it represents legitimate market needs. In this month's virtual self-study group, you will learn how to create and execute a plan to test for validity before you venture out on your own and start a new business to support your software creation.

LinkedIn has made the following course available for FREE for a limited time: Entrepreneurship: Finding and Testing Your Business Idea. All you need to begin is a LinkedIn account. Participating will take less than an hour, and you will receive a Certificate of Completion to add to your LinkedIn profile.

A requirement for participating in this virtual self-study group:

Once you sign up you will use the Event Comments to update your progress, share your product or service idea and solicit feedback from supportive Boston PHP members.

Note #1: This virtual self-study group activity began September 9, 2024 and ends September 30, 2024. (Meetup is not set up to handle multi-day events.)
