Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.

An agile project manager plans, leads, organizes and motivates agile project teams. Even if you don't aspire to become a project manager, you've likely been a member of an agile work team or will sometime in your career. Season 6 is less about the agile methodology and more about you and how your talents might complement or conflict with those of you teammates.

Welcome to summer school where the topics are light and the training is easy. In Season 6 we will use one assessment to help you Know Your Strength, whether in an agile work environment, or not.

Cangrade is a Cambridge-based company that offers a data-driven approach to hiring. They provide a free assessment to help you determine what drives your success?

Here is an example of how I used this assessment to identify What Drives My Success. The resulting Strength Report provides a data-based summary that can be shared in interview situations and team meetings.
