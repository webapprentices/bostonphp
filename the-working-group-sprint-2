<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/4/event_501900836.jpeg" border="0" /><br /><br />Welcome the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong>, a virtual support group for <strong>Boston PHP</strong> members. This group has been created to help the overworked and underworked land a better gig and the unworked land big.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong> is open to all Boston PHP members and will continue until at least May 31, 2022. The objective is to help one another work better. This could take one of two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>help the unworked find meaningful work</li>
<li>help the currently employed find more meaningful work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaningful work is defined by you. For some, it might mean greater pay and better benefits. For others it might take the form of better use of current skills or the opportunity to develop new skills.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint #2</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This event will consist of seven sprints. Each sprint will last approximately two weeks. <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53499072">Sprint #1</a></strong> began on February 15, 2022. During each sprint you commit to one deliverable that will help you advance toward your goal. You can't advance toward a goal until you know what that goal is. Your fellow Working Group members can't help you advance toward your goal until you communicate what your goal is.</p>
<p>In <strong>Sprint #1</strong> you demonstrated your commitment to this process by introducing yourself. If you have not yet done so, you can post an update on the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> message board. There, you will find simple instructions along with an example that I have posted. Share as much detail and support material as you chose. However, clarity is important. Do you have a clear idea of what meaningful work is to you and can you articulate your goal to others?</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine members signed up for The Working Group.</li>
<li>Two members made the commitment to actively participate by posting an Introduction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sprint #2</strong></p>
<p>If you are serious about moving your career forward, then take a moment to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> now. In <strong>Sprint #2</strong> we will dig deeper into the job search process. A FREE video course is available via <strong>LinkedIn Learning</strong> called <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/10-ways-to-stay-motivated-while-job-hunting">10 Ways to Stay Motivated While Job Hunting</a></strong>. After you <strong></strong>, watch this course and then post an update with at least one idea that caught your attention and how you will incorporate that idea into you job search strategy. All updates should be posted in one place <strong>—</strong> the <span><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area.</span></p>
<p>Job search is a contact sport. The more contacts you make with your fellow Boston PHP members and beyond, the more we can help you achieve your goal. We can't help you if you won't share what your goal is.</p>
