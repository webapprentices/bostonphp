Narrowing the skills gap, one video at a time.

All in with AI, Season 3 concludes in 10 days. Nine Boston PHP members signed up to participate. One member has introduced himself and provided links to his first three Certificates of Completion.

Next-to-Final Sprint

The assignment for this week is to select one of the six free AI courses, complete it, and post a link to your Certificate of Completion in the Comments section at the bottom of the Meetup page for this course. By posting an update, I'll have a better idea as to how many members are actively participating in this virtual self-study group.

Invite your co-workers and fellow techies to join this next-to-final sprint. Then, let's get (artificially) intelligent!
