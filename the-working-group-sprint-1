<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/4/event_501900836.jpeg" border="0" /><br /><br /><span>Welcome the </span><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong><span>, a virtual support group for <strong>Boston PHP</strong> members. This group has been created to help the overworked and underworked land a better gig and the unworked land big.</span></p>
<p>Officially, this "event" begins on March 1. Unofficially, let's begin.</p>
<p>The Working Group will remain open to all Boston PHP members and will continue until at least May 31, 2022. The objective is to help one another work better. This could take one of two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>help the unworked find meaningful work</li>
<li>help the currently employed find more meaningful work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaningful work is defined by you. For some, it might mean greater pay and better benefits. For others it might take the form of better use of current skills or the opportunity to develop new skills.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint #1</strong></p>
<p>This event will consist of seven sprints. Each sprint will last approximately two weeks. During each sprint you commit to one deliverable that will help advance you toward your goal. You can advane toward a goal until you know aht that goal is. Your fellow Working Group members can not help you advance toward your goal until to communicate what that goal is.</p>
<p>So, in <strong>Sprint #1</strong> you will demonstrate your commitment to this process by Introducing yourself. You can do so by postig an update on the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> message board. There you will find simple instructions along with an example that I hae posted. Share as much detail and support material as you chose. However, clarity is important. Do you have a clear idea of what meaningful work is to yu and can you articulate to others.</p>
<p>Please <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> before the end of <strong>Sprint #1</strong> which will conclude on Monday, February 20, 2022. You can also use the remaing time to get your assets together. Asset examples include resume, websites, tracking system, etc.</p>
<p>I'm glad you are part of <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong>. Let's start working together.</p>
