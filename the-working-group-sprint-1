<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/4/event_501900836.jpeg" border="0" /><br /><br /><span>Welcome the </span><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/283821265/">The Working Group</a></strong><span>, a virtual support group for <strong>Boston PHP</strong> members. This group has been created to help the overworked and underworked land a better gig and the unworked land big.</span></p>
<p>Officially, this "event" begins on March 1. Unofficially, let's get started.</p>
<p>The Working Group will remain open to all Boston PHP members and will continue until at least May 31, 2022. The objective is to help one another work better. This could take one of two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>help the unworked find meaningful work</li>
<li>help the currently employed find more meaningful work</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaningful work is defined by you. For some, it might mean greater pay and better benefits. For others it might take the form of better use of current skills or the opportunity to develop new skills.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint #1</strong></p>
<p>This event will consist of seven sprints. Each sprint will last approximately two weeks. During each sprint you commit to one deliverable that will help you advance toward your goal. You can't advance toward a goal until you know what that goal is. Your fellow Working Group members can't help you advance toward your goal until you communicate what your goal is.</p>
<p>So, in <strong>Sprint #1</strong> you will demonstrate your commitment to this process by introducing yourself. You can do so by posting an update on the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> message board. There, you will find simple instructions along with an example that I have posted. Share as much detail and support material as you chose. However, clarity is important. Do you have a clear idea of what meaningful work is to you and can you articulate your goal to others?</p>
<p>Please <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53491175">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> before the end of <strong>Sprint #1</strong> which will conclude on Monday, February 28, 2022. You can also use the remaining time to get your assets together. Asset examples include resume, websites, tracking system, etc.</p>
