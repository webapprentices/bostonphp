Narrowing the skills gap one video at a time.

As February comes to a close, we are approaching the end of our monthly virtual self-study groupâ€”a FREE three-hour, video-based course entitled Getting a Software Engineering Job. Once you complete the course you will receive a Certificate of Completion that you can post to your LinkedIn account.

Also, post your Certificate in the Comments section at the bottom of the Meetup post for this course so that I can gauge participation among our 29 registrants. If you have not yet completed the course, you can simply post a progress update like the examples I posted.

Your thoughts and comments are also welcome. Let's help each other in Getting a Software Engineering Job, or any other technical job that you desire.
