Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.

Microsoft has packaged a six-course program entitled Career Essentials in Generative AI by Microsoft and LinkedIn (Microsoft owns LinkedIn). In addition, they have made this learning path FREE for a limited time. No LinkedIn Learning paid subscription required; only a LinkedIn profile.

Virtual Winter

Welcome to the Winter Session of our virtual self-study group initiative. In this introductory learning path we will cover the following six courses:

What Is Generative AI?

Generative AI: The Evolution of Thoughtful Online Search

Streamlining Your Work with Copilot (formerly Bing Chat/Bing Chat Enterprise)

Microsoft 365 Copilot First Look

Ethics in the Age of Generative AI

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Each course includes no more than one hour of training material on average. Upon completing each course you will receive a certificate to post to your LinkedIn profile. In addition, you will receive a certificate for successfully completing the entire six-course learning path (seven total certificates).

Why Obtain a Certificate?

80 percent of HR professionals rely on certifications during the hiring process. Why? Many donâ€™t have the grasp of technical skills necessary to thoroughly evaluate candidates, so they need a third-party source to certify skills. [ Source: Dice ]
