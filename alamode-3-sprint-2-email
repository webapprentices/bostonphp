[b] [/b]Welcome to [b]Sprint #1[/b] of [b][url=https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/294062551/]API a la Mode, Season 3[/url][/b]. Let's begin.

This sprint will last one week and will cover the first of three units in the [b][url=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/apis-for-beginners/]APIs for Beginners Tutorial[/url][/b]—a free course offered by freeCodeCamp.

If you have not yet done so, please post a brief update to [b][url=https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53905621/]Introduce Yourself[/url][/b] which will acknowledge your commitment to begin this training opportunity. Next, we will conduct three sprints over the next three weeks to complete the three units in this video-based training.

[b]Sprint #1[/b] covers [b]What is an API?[/b] This first of three sprints begins on June 19 and concludes on June 25, 2023. Once you complete this one-hour unit, please post an update at [b][url=https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53906208]Sprint #1—API a la Mode, Season 3[/url][/b] so that I can monitor participant progress.
