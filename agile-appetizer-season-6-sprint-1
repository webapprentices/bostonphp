<p><strong></strong>Welcome to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/287264577/">Agile Appetizer, Season 6</a></strong>. If you work, especially with others, then it is to your advantage to <strong>Know Your Strengths</strong>. Season 6 will help you do that.</p>
<p>Take a moment to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53635685">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> and share your experience with participating on an agile team so that we can gauge participation. Then, proceed with the <strong><a href="https://app.cangrade.com/html/landing/strength/">free assessment</a></strong>. The resulting <strong>Strength Report</strong> provides a summary that can be shared in interview situations and team meetings. Share your results in the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53635685">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area.</p>
<p>That's it!Â <span>This is summer school where the topics are light and the training is easy. We have two weeks to complete this one and only sprint.</span></p>
<p><span>Let's get agile!</span></p>
