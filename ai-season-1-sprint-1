<p><strong>Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter or video at a time.</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/288157601/">All In with AI, Season 1</a></strong>. Let's begin.</p>
<p>This is the first of five weekly sprints. Once you complete each course (two courses per sprint) you will receive a certificate to post to your LinkedIn profile. To demonstrate your commitment to begin this virtual self-study group opportunity, post a message to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/54170791">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> to your fellow Boston PHP members. This will help us monitor interest among participants. We have 14 life-long learners who have signed up to begin this AI journey.</p>
<p>Next, gain access to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/applying-ai-as-a-tech-leader">Applying AI as a Tech Leader</a></strong>. This learning path has been made available for <strong>FREE</strong> for a limited time. Once you complete the first two courses (<strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/54171548">Course 1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/54172631">Course 2</a></strong>), post a message, along with a link to your certificate of completion, in the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/forum/29448955/">All In with AI, Season 1</a></strong> discussion area.</p>
<p>Finally, a complete list of weekly sprints can be found in <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/54171532/">Master Discussion List—All In with AI, Season 1</a></strong>. Post any questions you might have in the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/54170791">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area.</p>
