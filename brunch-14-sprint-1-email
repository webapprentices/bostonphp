<p><strong></strong>Welcome to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/290173238/">HTML5 Brunch, Season 14</a></strong>. Ten Boston PHP members have signed up to participate in <strong>Season 14</strong>. We will conduct four sprints. Each sprint will last one week. By the end we will have completed just under two hours of CSS training and earned a certificate we can add to our LinkedIn profiles.</p>
<p>Begin by gaining access to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-for-programmers">CSS for Programmers</a></strong>—a <em>free </em><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedIn Learning</a></strong> course integrated with <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHIpkXWQgAI">GitHub Codespaces</a></strong>. Then proceed to the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53781877">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area on the Boston PHP Meetup website.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53782003">Master Discussion List</a></strong> contains links to the discussion areas for each of the four sprints. Feel free to bookmark this <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53782003">Master Discussion List</a></strong> for easy access. Once you complete the first sprint, post an update in <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53782086">Sprint #1: The Basics</a></strong>. If you have any questions about how to proceed, please post a message in the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53781877">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area.</p>
