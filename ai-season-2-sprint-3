Narrowing the skills gap, one video at a time.
The second one-week sprint has concluded. Nine Boston PHP members signed up to participate. One member has introduced himself and provided a link to his first two Certificates of Completion.

Sprint 3
The assignment for this week is to select one of the 10 free AI courses, complete it, and post your Certificate of Completion in the Comments section at the bottom of the Meetup page for this course. By posting an update, I'll have a better idea as to how many members are participating in this virtual self-study group.

Invite your co-workers and fellow techies to join in the fun. Then, let's get (artificially) intelligent!
