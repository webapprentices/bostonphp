LinkedIn Learning is All In with AI. This training site has made the following Learning Path FREE for a limited time: Applying AI as a Tech Leader. The Learning Path consists of 10 courses, each approximately one hour long. Upon completing each course you will receive a certificate you can post to your LinkedIn profile. Season 1 will consist of five weeks of sprints. Join us and we'll learn about artificial intelligence together.

LinkedIn Learning has classified this Learning Path as Level 2 on their AI Upskilling Framework. The five levels are as follows: 

Understanding

Applying

Building

Training & Maintaining Models

Deeply Specializing

Additional Learning Paths are available at different Upskilling levels.

Why Obtain a Certificate?

The majority of HR professionals rely on certifications during the hiring process. Why? Many donâ€™t have the grasp of technical skills necessary to thoroughly evaluate candidates, so they need a third-party source to certify skills. [ Source: Dice ]
