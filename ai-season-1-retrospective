Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter or video at a time.

All In with AI, Season 1 has now concluded.

The Final Scorecard

~ 15 members signed up for All In with AI, Season 1
~ 8 members made the commitment to begin by posting to Introduce Yourself
~ 1 member completed all 10 courses

In lieu of a formal sprint retrospective, I welcome feedback on the following three questions:

What worked well for you?
What didn't work well for you?
What can be improved?
Please provide your feedback in a direct message to me via Meetup.

Lastly, according to Meetup, message boards will no longer be available after July 18, 2024. It remains unclear how this development will affect our virtual self-study group initiative.

Thanks for your support since our first virtual self-study group, PHP Percolate, was launched on January 1, 2011.
