<p><strong>The Final Scorecard</strong></p>
<p>~ 15 members signed up forÂ <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/288157601/">All In with AI, Season 1<br /></a></strong>~ 8 members made the commitment to begin by posting to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/boards/thread/54170791/">Introduce Yourself</a></strong><br />~ 1 member completed all 10 courses</p>
<p>In lieu of a formal sprint retrospective, I welcome feedback on the following three questions:</p>
<ul class="i8Z77e">
<li class="TrT0Xe">What worked well for you?</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">What didn't work well for you?</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">What can be improved?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please provide your feedback in a <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/members/2410152/">direct message to me</a></strong> via Meetup.</p>
<p>Lastly, according to Meetup, <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/">m</a><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/">essage boards will no longer be available after July 18, 2024</a></strong>. It remains unclear how this development will affect our virtual self-study group initiative going forward.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support since our first virtual self-study group, <strong>PHP Percolate!</strong>, was launched on January 1, 2011. I'd like to think I made a difference.</p>
