[b]Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.[/b]

Welcome to the [b]Introduce Yourself[/b] discussion area for [b][url=https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/293162500/]Intro to Software Development[/url][/b]. Begin by gaining access to [b][url=https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/career-essentials-in-software-development-by-microsoft-and-linkedin]Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn[/url][/b]. This Learning Path has been made available for FREE for a limited time.

[ EDIT ]

Once you complete the three short videos in the [b]Introduction[/b] section, [b]click "Add a reply"[/b] and post a comment introducing yourself to your fellow classmates. Also [b]provide a link to your GitHub account[/b]. This will help us gauge how many registrants have made the commitment to begin self-study training.

[b]NOTE:[/b] Apparently, the use of Codespaces is not exactly free. This was never explained. After you download code to your GitHub account, the clock starts ticking, and you may start receiving e-mails about usage and spending. You can read more at [b][url=https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces]About billing for GitHub Codespaces[/url][/b]. I'll offer updates once I decipher what this means.
