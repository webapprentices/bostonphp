Narrowing the skills gap, one video at a time.
The first one-week sprint has concluded. Seven Boston PHP members signed up to participate. One member has introduced himself and provided a link to his first Certificate of Completion.

Sprint 2
The assignment for this week is to select one of the 10 free AI courses, complete it, and post your Certificate of Completion in the Comments section at the bottom of the Meetup page for this course.

Invite your co-workers and fellow techies to join in the fun. Then, let's get (artificially) intelligent!
