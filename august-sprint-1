<p><strong></strong>Welcome to the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/278877694/">Post Pandemic Challenge</a></strong>. The Challenge began on July 1 with <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53280088">July Sprint #1</a></strong> and continued with <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53293871">July Sprint #2</a></strong>. The second sprint ended at the end of July. Here is where we stand ...</p>

<p><strong>August Sprint #1</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This sprint began <strong>Sunday, August 1</strong> and concludes <strong>Sunday, August 15</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/278877694/">Post Pandemic Challenge</a></strong> will last six months and is divided into 12 sprints. There will be two sprints per month, so each sprint will last approximately two weeks. The challenge is to complete one course during a sprint. Courses range in duration from one hour to five hours. So, a longer course might require two sprints to complete. If you budget your time and proceed at a pace of 90 minutes per week, you will complete the challenge.</p>
<p>The next action, for willing participants, is to review <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53267065">Post Pandemic Challenge &gt; Getting Started</a>.</strong> Then, post an Introduction (15-minute stand-up) stating what you will commit to work on during this sprint. You can also post any barriers you might be encountering in shifting into post pandemic gear in the comments under <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53267065">Post Pandemic Challenge &gt; Getting Started</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/278877694/">Post Pandemic Challenge</a></strong> covers 11 courses. You can participate in as many courses as you like, in any order. Each time you complete a course, you receive a certificate that you can post to your LinkedIn account. Complete all 11 courses and receive a bonus certificate signifying that you have <strong><a href="https://opportunity.linkedin.com/skills-for-in-demand-jobs/software-developer">Become a Software Developer</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will continue to push back the start date near the end of each month for the remainder of the year. This does not delay the start (we began on July 1). I adjust the start date to keep this Meetup on the event schedule. The effect is to allow any member to join at any time and begin the Challenge. So, invite your coworkers to take the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/278877694/">Post Pandemic Challenge</a></strong> with you and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-software-developer">Become a Software Developer</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Even though this is a challenge, it doesn't mean it can't be fun. Let's keep sprinting, or running, or jogging, or slogging, or walking, or crawling, whichever works for you.</p>
