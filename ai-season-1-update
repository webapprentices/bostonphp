<p><strong>Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter or video at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/288157601/">All In with AI, Season 1</a> </strong>has now concluded. As of today, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/learning-and-development/new-framework-for-ai-upskilling">LinkedIn Learning no longer offers this Learning Path for free</a></strong>. Please update any progress you've made during the last few sprints by accessing the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/54171532/">Master Discussion List—All In with AI, Season 1</a></strong> and posting links to the certificates you've earned. I will provide a final sprint retrospective within the next few days.</p>
