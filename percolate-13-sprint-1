<p><strong>Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.</strong></p>
<p><span>Welcome to </span><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/290145271/">PHP Percolate, Season 13</a></strong><span>. Seven Boston PHP members have signed up to participate in Season 13. We will conduct three sprints. Each sprint will last one week. By the end we will have completed just under two hours of PHP training and earned a certificate we can add to our LinkedIn profiles.</span></p>
