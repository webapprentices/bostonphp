Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.

GitHub is the industry-standard tool for collaborating on and sharing code. Season 6 is less about sharing code and more about presentation.

Welcome to summer school where the topics are light and the training is easy. In Season 6 we will use one tutorial to improve your GitHub presentation: How to Create an Impressive GitHub Profile README.

Currently, Indeed lists more than 800 job openings in the Boston metro area that mention GitHub in the job description. If you provide a link on your resume and social media profiles to GitHub, then it is to your advantage to make sure that your GitHub Overview page is attractive and well-organized.
