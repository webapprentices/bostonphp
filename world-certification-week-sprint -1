Welcome to World Certification Week. This is your opportunity to obtain at least one certification in social media marketing from HubSpot Academy. All training and certification is offered FREE of charge.

This Social Side Dish virtual self-study group is divided into two one-week sprints. In Sprint #1 you decide which certificate to pursue and begin learning. In Sprint #2 you sit for the certification exam.

Your Next Action

The next step is to Introduce Yourself and let your fellow Boston PHP participants know about your interests and reasons for pursuing social media marketing certification. In the  Introduce Yourself discussion area you will gain access to several popular certifications you might want to pursue. Review these options, make a decision and begin learning.

If you have any questions, please post them in the Introduce Yourself discussion area.
