Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.

If you are on the periphery of software development and want to expand your knowledge, this virtual self-study group is for you.

~ Perhaps you're just starting your technology career.

~ Maybe you have technology experience, just not in software development.

~ Perhaps you're currently working in recruiting or human resources or project management.

~ Maybe you're working in another career field entirely and want to learn more about opportunities in software development.

Microsoft has packaged a three-course program entitled Career Essentials in Software Development by Microsoft and LinkedIn (Microsoft owns LinkedIn). In addition, they have made this learning path FREE for a limited time. No LinkedIn Learning paid subscription required; only a LinkedIn profile.

Summer School

Welcome to summer school where the topics are light and the training is easy. In this introductory learning path we will cover the following three courses:

Introduction to Career Skills in Software Development

Programming Foundations: Fundamentals

Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals

Each course includes two hours of training material. Upon completing each course you will receive a certificate to post to your LinkedIn profile. In addition, you will receive a certificate for successfully completing the three-course learning path.

Why Obtain a Certificate?

80 percent of HR professionals rely on certifications during the hiring process. Why? Many donâ€™t have the grasp of technical skills necessary to thoroughly evaluate candidates, so they need a third-party source to certify skills. [ Source: Dice ]
