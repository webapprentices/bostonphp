[b]Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.[/b]

Welcome to the [b]Introduce Yourself[/b] discussion area for [b][url=https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/292137096/]Agile Appetizer, Season 7[/url][/b]. Begin by creating a free account at [b][url=https://kickoff.pmi.org/]PMI Kickoff[/url][/b] and accessing the [b]Agile Course[/b] (not the Predictive Course).

To begin, [b]click "Add a reply"[/b] and post a comment introducing yourself to your fellow classmates. Include in your comments your interest in participating in this self-paced learning opportunity. Your introduction will help us gauge how many registrants have made the commitment to begin self-study training.

[b]NOTE:[/b] There is no Master Discussion List for Season 7 since there is only one sprint that will last two weeks. Once you complete this sprint, simply post a link to the badge you earned from the Project Management Institute.
