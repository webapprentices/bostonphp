<p><strong></strong>Welcome to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/286224946/">Git Lunch, Season 6</a></strong>. Let's <strong>git started</strong>.</p>
<p>If you provide a link on your resume and social media profiles to <strong>GitHub</strong>, then it's to your advantage to make sure that your <strong>GitHub Overview</strong> page is attractive and well-organized. <strong>Season 6</strong> will help you do that.</p>
<p>Take a moment to visit the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53596017">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion page and share a link to your <strong>GitHub</strong> account. Offer a brief statement about the code you post there. Then, review <strong><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/github-profile-readme/">How to Create an Impressive GitHub Profile README</a></strong> and begin upgrading your Overview page.</p>
<p>This is summer school where the topics are light and the training is easy. <strong>Season 6</strong> will continue for three weeks and will conclude on Saturday, July 30. This first sprint will last two weeks which is plenty of time to review <strong><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/github-profile-readme/">How to Create an Impressive GitHub Profile README</a></strong> and begin upgrading your Overview page. Make sure you post progress updates, questions and comments to the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53596017">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion page.</p>
<p>Let's <strong>git going</strong>.</p>
