<p><strong> </strong>Welcome to <strong>Sprint #1</strong> of <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/294062551/">API a la Mode, Season 3</a></strong>. Let's begin.</p>
<p>This sprint will last one week and will cover the first of three units in the <strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/apis-for-beginners/">APIs for Beginners Tutorial</a></strong>—a free course offered by freeCodeCamp.</p>

Next, we will conduct three sprints over the next three weeks to complete the three units in this video-based training.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint #1</strong> covers <strong>What is an API?</strong> This first of three sprints begins on June 19 and concludes on June 25, 2023. Once you complete this one-hour unit, please post an update at <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53906208">Sprint #1—API a la Mode, Season 3</a></strong> so that I can monitor participant progress.
