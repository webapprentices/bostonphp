<p><strong></strong>Welcome to <strong>Git Lunch, Season 7</strong>. Eight Boston PHP members have signed up to participate in <strong>Season 7</strong>. We will conduct four sprints. Each sprint will last one week. By the end we will have completed just under two hours of Git training and earned a certificate we can add to our LinkedIn profiles.</p>
<p>Begin by gaining access to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/8-git-commands-you-should-know-16027523">8 Git Commits You Should Know</a></strong>â€”a <em>free </em><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedIn Learning</a></strong> course integrated with <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHIpkXWQgAI">GitHub Codespaces</a></strong>. Then proceed to the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53787626">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area on the Boston PHP Meetup website.</p>
