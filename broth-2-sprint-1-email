<p><strong>Narrowing the skills gap, one chapter at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Welcome to <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/290172758/">JavaScript Broth, Season 2</a></strong>. Eighteen Boston PHP members have signed up to participate in Season 2. We will conduct three sprints. Each sprint will last one week. By the end we will have completed just under two hours of JavaScript training and earned a certificate we can add to our LinkedIn profiles.</p>
<p>Begin by gaining access to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/hands-on-introduction-javascript">Hands-On Introduction: JavaScript</a></strong>â€”a <em>free </em><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedIn Learning</a></strong> course integrated with <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHIpkXWQgAI">GitHub Codespaces</a></strong>. Then proceed to the <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53776625">Introduce Yourself</a></strong> discussion area on the Boston PHP Meetup website.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53776388">Master Discussion List</a></strong> contains links to the discussion areas for each of the three sprints. Feel free to bookmark this <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53776388">Master Discussion List</a></strong> for easy access. Once you complete the first sprint, post an update in <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53776632">Sprint #1: Picking JS Apart</a></strong>.
