<p><strong>Boston PHP Meetup</strong> is the largest education-focused Meetup in New England with more than 3,800 members. Our mission is to engage members in continuing education efforts. As a result, we offer services beyond in-person meetups. A cornerstone of our member engagement strategy is the <strong>virtual self-study group</strong> initiative called <strong>Web Apprentices</strong>.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 2020, three regional PHP Meetup groups formed an alliance to offer virtual meetings during the global pandemic. Five additional user groups have joined since. This alliance, called <strong>MergePHP</strong>, provides educational services to more than 10,000 web developers.</p>

<p>This educational service uses the Meetup.com infrastructure (events and message boards) to coordinate learning opportunities for its members.</p>
