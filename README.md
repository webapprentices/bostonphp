<p>Boston PHP Meetup is the largest education-focused Meetup in New England with more than 3,800 members. Our mission is to engage members in continuing education efforts. As a result, we offer services beyond in-person meetups. A cornerstone of our member engagement strategy is this virtual self-study group initiative called Web Apprentices.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 2020, three regional PHP Meetup groups formed an alliance to offer virtual meetings during the global pandemic. Five additional user groups have joined since, forming an alliance called MergePHP and servicing more than 10,000 web developers.</p>
