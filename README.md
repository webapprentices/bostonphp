<p><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/" target="_blank">Boston PHP Meetup</a></strong> is the largest education-focused Meetup in New England with more than 3,800 members. Our mission is to engage members in continuing education efforts. As a result, we offer services beyond in-person meetups. A cornerstone of our member engagement strategy is the <strong>virtual self-study group</strong> initiative called <strong><a href="https://webapprentices.org/about-web-apprentices/" target="_blank">Web Apprentices</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 2020, three regional PHP Meetup groups formed an alliance to offer virtual meetings during the global pandemic. Five additional user groups have joined since. This alliance, called <strong><a href="https://mergephp.carrd.co/" target="_blank">MergePHP</a></strong>, provides educational services to more than 10,000 web developers.</p>

<p>The Meetup.com infrastructure (events and message boards) is used to coordinate learning opportunities for its members.</p>

<p>This repository holds code written for virtual self-study group communications published on <strong>Boston PHP Meetup</strong>.</p>
