<p><strong>October Sprint #1</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The next sprint begins <strong>Friday, October 1</strong> and concludes <strong>Friday, October 15</strong>.</p>
<p>So look, maybe learning how to <strong><a href="https://opportunity.linkedin.com/skills-for-in-demand-jobs/software-developer">Become a Software Developer</a></strong> is not your cup of tea. Are you aware that there are <strong><a href="https://opportunity.linkedin.com/skills-for-in-demand-jobs">nine other Learning Paths</a></strong> that you can pursue -- for <strong>FREE</strong> -- until the end of December! For example, in the last three months I completed the 11-course <strong><a href="https://webapprentices.org/become-a-digital-marketing-specialist/">Become a Digital Marketing Specialist</a></strong> path.</p>
<p>What are you willing to commit to? The next action, for those 17 registrants who have not yet made a commitment to begin, is to review <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53267065">Post Pandemic Challenge &gt; Getting Started</a>.</strong> Then, post an Introduction stating what you will commit to work on during this two-week sprint. You can also post any barriers you might be encountering in shifting into post pandemic gear in the comments under <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/53267065">Post Pandemic Challenge &gt; Getting Started</a></strong>.</p>
<p>What will you learn today? How can I help you get started?</p>
